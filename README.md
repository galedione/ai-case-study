# IBM  

## IBM "International Business Machines" in 1924 became the leading manufacturer of punch-card tabulating systems. IBM was founded in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), a holding company of manufacturers of record-keeping and measuring systems. 
* International Business Machines (IBM). 
* IBM was founded and incorporated June 16, 1911, Endicott, NY, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), a holding company of manufacturers of record-keeping and measuring systems by: Charles Ranlett Flint, Herman Hollerith and Thomas J. Watson. 
* IBM began its initial forays into computing, which constituted incremental improvements to the prevailing card-based system. A pivotal moment arrived in the 1960s with the introduction of the System/360 family of mainframe computers. IBM provided a comprehensive spectrum of hardware, software, and service agreements, fostering client loyalty and solidifying its moniker “Big Blue.” The customized nature of end-user software, tailored by in-house programmers for specific brand of computers, deterred brand switching due to its associated costs. Despite challenges posed by clone makers like Amdahl and legal confrontations, IBM leveraged its esteemed reputation, assuring clients with both hardware and system software solutions, earning acclaim as one of the esteemed American corporations during the 1970s and 1980s.
* IBM has unveiled a $500 million venture fund invest in AI companies, ranging from early-stage startups to high-growth enterprises. IBM and its competitors have raised over $30.6B in funding across 2091 funding rounds involving 3587 investors. 

## Business Activities
* The IBM business activities is based on providing various technological solutions and services to businesses. They make money by charging their clients for several products and services, including cloud storage, computers upgrades, accessories, systems, and services. IBM has invested in various research and development projects, including big data, quantum computing, and blockchain technology, which may offer new revenue streams in the future. 
* The specific problem IBM project trying to solve is AI, big data machine learning and has the potential to change millions of lives. In this way, the teams can shave years of even decades of work from traditional fixes for stubborn social problems. For example, the opioid project starts from the proven premise that most opioid abuse and addiction starts with a prescription. The team can use Watson’s unparalleled abilities to recognize addiction patterns, learn evidence-based rules for more responsible prescription writing, and then develop early warning systems of use by healthcare professionals and public health officials. 
* IBM Marketing Strategy in the highly competitive tech industry, having a strong marketing strategy is crucial for sustaining leadership. IBM recognizes the importance of effective marketing in staying ahead of the curve and maintaining its position as tech industry leader. By leveraging its brand positioning, targeting the right market segments, establishing though leadership, driving innovation, utilizing digital marketing and social media, forming strategic partnerships, and nurturing customer relationships, IBM has been able to create a comprehensive marketing strategy that sets it apart from its competitors. In 2022, IBM generated global revenues of over 60 billion U.S. dollars, with around 50 percent of this generated in the Americas region. IBM’s research, development, and engineering expenditure amounted to 6.57 billion U.S. dollars in 2922 as it continues to innovate, with a particular focus on AI and hybrid cloud technologies. 
* IBM solution offers strong focus on AI and Data Analytics with its advanced AI capabilities, notably IBM Watson, the company offers unique solutions in data analytics, AI integration, and cognitive computing. This positions IBM as a leader in transforming traditional business processes through AI. IBM’s competitive advantage is the interconnectedness of its offerings, which span IT consulting, outsourcing, hardware, software and cloud services. Many of these offerings are interconnected, primarily though IBM’s consulting business. 
* IBM is currently using blockchain, quantum computing and cognitive technology. IBM also invests heavily in semiconductor research as it investigates chips to support cloud computing and big data systems. They are implementing by seizing the digital advantage through new technologies, new expertise, new focus – and new ways of working. 
## Landscape

* IBM concentrates on computer services, software, supercomputers, and scientific research. 
* For more than a century, IBM has been rooted in the fundamental promise of technology: They apply science to real-world problems, we can make progress-for both business and society. And as those problems have changed over time, so have we. IBM has repeatedly reinvented itself to overcome whatever obstacles stand in the way of innovation and value for their clients. 
* The ten (10) top major IT companies in the IBM field are: Apple, Samsung, Hon Hai Precision Industry, Microsoft, Dell, Sony, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Lenovo, Intel Corp, and Panasonic. 

## Results

* IBM impact has exports about $12 billion annually in goods and services from the U.S. to over 120 countries, including $5 billion in software, making us one of the country’s largest software exporters. 
* IBM Data Replication CDC replication operates as a pipeline of components that moves data changes through several components on its way from the source database to the target system. From a performance perspective, the system as a whole can only operate as fast as the slowest component. The following components are potential bottlenecks in the replication in the pipeline components that are located downstream from the log reader. 
* IBM performance is efficient because changes are planned and managed. Managing performance of any system can be a complex task that requires a through understanding  the system’s hardware and software. IBM is an industry leader in the area of performance management and has many qualities that are not found in other systems, including unparalleled performance metrics, always-on collection services, and graphical viewing of performance data. While understanding all the different processes that affect system performance can be challenging and resolving performance problems requires the effective use of large suite of tools, the functions offered by IBM are intended to make jobs easier for users. 

## Recommendations
* I would suggest that IBM provide cloud integrated SaaS applications across finance, HR supply chain, sales, marketing and service. Their applications should use a common dates model for transactions across lines of business for seamless process flows, improved efficiency and better insights. 
* Having this offer will have a competitive advantage over its competitors by providing value with a focus on highly customized software that meets all needs of the clients. 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? It will utilize high performance, data security, reliability and availability, and advanced analytics. IBM would provide seamless integration with various applications and systems, enabling data exchange and workflow automation. 
*Overall, technology solutions can provide organizations with a wide range of benefits. By investing in the right solutions, organizations, can improve their security, increase their productivity, save money and stay competitive.
